        The week of the initial launch, I formalized the arrangement by
        registering an LLP and successfully negotiating the first contract
        directly with the university's rector. The revenue from this contract
        was sufficient to sustain the project's ongoing development.
      </p>
      <p>
        For years, I treated the project as a side venture, using it as a
        sandbox to continuously learn new technologies, refactor its
        architecture, and add new features. I even worked on it full-time
        between jobs. However, I focused solely on the product while heavily
        neglecting the revenue component.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, to validate the market and raise the product's pricing, I
        made the decisive choice to leave my job and try transforming the
        project into a full-fledged startup.

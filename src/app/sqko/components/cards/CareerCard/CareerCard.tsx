        Despite leaving a high-paying job, I'm glad I pursued entrepreneurship.
        The experience pushed my limits and gave me a deeper understanding of my
        strengths and weaknesses. The journey also taught me many skills and
        allowed me to positively impact the daily lives of university officers
        and the entire student body.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a person who thrives on focusing on a single project, I knew I had to
        make a choice: either persist with the company amidst growing
        competition or sunset the project to focus on a career. I chose the
        latter, and I'm now committed to becoming a world-class expert in my
        areas of interest over the next decade.

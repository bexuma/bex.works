        In January 2019, after transferring to Karaganda University of
        Kazpotrebsoyuz, I was asked to develop a website for the universityâ€™s
        Student Service Center (SSC). The goal was to expand on their recently
        launched live queueing system by allowing students to apply for services
        online. Although I was working on a personal project at the time, I
        prioritized this initiative, seeing it as a unique opportunity to
        observe the effects of my work on the daily operations at the
        university.
      </p>

        While juggling my studies, I built a functional prototype in 40 days.
        The first version of the website launched 40 days later becoming my
        first project with active users.

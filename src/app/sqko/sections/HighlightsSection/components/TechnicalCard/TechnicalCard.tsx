        The platformâ€™s architecture evolved from a simpler client-server setup
        to a microservice-based system, driven by continuous technical
        modernization.

            'Migrating from Bootstrap to custom components to MUI, from class to functional components, and upgrading to TypeScript',

        Throughout iterations, by retiring features like the Application Time
        Machine and shutting down the mobile app development, I learned to not
        overcomplicate the product and to focus on key features.
